# Adafruit IO:The Internet of Things for Everyone
The Adafruit IO HTTP API provides access to your Adafruit IO data from any programming language or hardware environment that can speak HTTP. The easiest way to get started is with an [Adafruit IO learn guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/adafruit-io-basics) and a simple Internet of Things capable device like the Feather Huzzah[https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).

# Adafruit IO Cient Libraries
We have lots of client libraries to help you get started with your project: 
* [Arduino C++](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Arduino)
* [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_AdafruitIO/)
* [Python](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Python)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-ruby)
* [Javascript](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-io-node)
* [Go](https://github.com/adafruit/io-client-go)

They're all open source, so if they don't already do what you want, you can fork them and add any feature you'd like.
